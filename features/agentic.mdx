Agentic mode gives LLMs tools to explore your codebase, then propose file edits with permission prompts — like Claude Code, but for any LLM.

## Usage

Use the `@agent` syntax to trigger agentic mode:

```bash
@claude fix the bug in src/utils.ts
@gemini add error handling to api/routes.ts
@ollama create a hello world script
```

Or use commands:

```bash
/plan @claude refactor the auth system      # Plan only (no execution)
/build @claude implement the login form     # Full implementation with tools
```

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `view` | Read file contents with line numbers |
| `glob` | Find files by pattern (e.g., `**/*.ts`) |
| `grep` | Search file contents with regex |
| `bash` | Execute shell commands |
| `write` | Create or overwrite files |
| `edit` | Search and replace in files |

## Permission Prompts

Every tool call shows a permission prompt:

- **Allow** — Execute this tool call
- **Allow from directory** — Auto-approve reads from this directory
- **Allow all reads** — Auto-approve all file reads
- **Deny** — Skip this tool call
- **Esc** — Cancel entire operation

<Note>Claude and Ollama fully respect permission prompts. Gemini and Codex have built-in file reading that may bypass prompts.</Note>

## Plan vs Build Mode

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Plan** | LLM analyzes and describes approach, no file changes |
| **Build** | LLM explores and edits with full tool access |

Toggle with `Tab` in the TUI.

## Live Tool Activity

When the LLM uses tools, you see:

- **●** Green = completed
- **●** Yellow = running
- **●** Red = error
- **●** Gray = pending

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe the task">
    Use `@agent` syntax: `@claude fix the login bug`
  </Step>
  <Step title="LLM explores">
    The LLM uses view, glob, grep to understand your codebase
  </Step>
  <Step title="Permission prompts">
    Each tool call shows a prompt — you approve or deny
  </Step>
  <Step title="LLM proposes edits">
    The LLM uses write/edit to propose changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review diff">
    You see a diff preview and approve or reject each change
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply changes">
    Approved changes are written to disk
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Consensus → Agentic Workflow

Run consensus first, then continue with an agent:

```bash
/consensus claude,gemini "best approach for auth"
# Choose "Continue"
@claude implement this    # Has consensus context
```

The consensus result is automatically injected as context.

## Agent Support

| Agent | Agentic Support |
|-------|-----------------|
| Claude | ✅ Full support |
| Ollama | ✅ Full support |
| Gemini | ⚠️ Auto-reads files (bypasses prompts) |
| Codex | ⚠️ Auto-reads files (bypasses prompts) |
| Mistral | ⚠️ Inconsistent |
