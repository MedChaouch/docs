title: "Agentic Mode"
description: "LLMs explore your codebase and propose edits"
---

Agentic mode gives LLMs tools to explore your codebase, then propose file edits with permission prompts — like Claude Code, but for any LLM.

## Usage

The TUI runs in agentic mode by default. Just type your task:

```bash
fix the bug in src/utils.ts
add error handling to api/routes.ts
create a hello world script
```

Set the agent for your tasks:

```bash
/agent claude    # Use Claude
/agent gemini    # Use Gemini
/agent ollama    # Use local Ollama
```

<Tip>See [Model Selection](/features/models) to configure which model each agent uses.</Tip>

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `view` | Read file contents with line numbers |
| `glob` | Find files by pattern (e.g., `**/*.ts`) |
| `grep` | Search file contents with regex |
| `bash` | Execute shell commands |
| `write` | Create or overwrite files |
| `edit` | Search and replace in files |

## Approval Modes

Control how permissions and file edits are handled with `/approval-mode`:

| Mode | Permissions | File Edits | Use Case |
|------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Default** | Ask for each | Diff review | Normal development |
| **Plan** | Ask for each | Show plan only | Planning/reviewing |
| **Accept** | Ask for each | Auto-apply | Faster iteration |
| **YOLO** | Auto-approve | Auto-apply | Full trust, max speed |

## Permission Prompts

In Default and Plan modes, every tool call shows a permission prompt:

- **Allow** — Execute this tool call
- **Allow from directory** — Auto-approve reads from this directory
- **Allow all reads** — Auto-approve all file reads
- **Allow all edits** — Auto-approve all file writes for this session
- **Deny** — Skip this tool call
- **Esc** — Cancel entire operation

<Tip>"Allow all edits" persists across messages in the same session — useful when you trust the agent to make multiple changes.</Tip>

## Trust Management

Pre-approve directories so the agent can read files without prompts:

```bash
/trusted                  # List trusted directories
/trusted add ./src        # Trust the src folder
/trusted add .            # Trust current directory
/trusted remove ./src     # Remove trust
```

Files in trusted directories are auto-approved for read operations.

## Live Tool Activity

When the LLM uses tools, you see:

- **●** Green = completed
- **●** Yellow = running
- **●** Red = error
- **●** Gray = pending

Press `Ctrl+S` to expand/collapse full output.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe the task">
    Type your request in the TUI
  </Step>
  <Step title="LLM explores">
    The LLM uses view, glob, grep to understand your codebase
  </Step>
  <Step title="Permission prompts">
    Each tool call shows a prompt — you approve or deny
  </Step>
  <Step title="LLM proposes edits">
    The LLM uses write/edit to propose changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review diff">
    You see a diff preview and approve or reject each change
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply changes">
    Approved changes are written to disk
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Consensus → Agentic Workflow

Run consensus first, then continue with the agent:

```bash
/consensus claude,gemini "best approach for auth"
# Choose "Continue"
# Type your follow-up — has consensus context
```

The consensus result is automatically injected as context.

## Agent Support

| Agent | Agentic Support |
|-------|-----------------|
| Claude | Full support — uses our tool system |
| Ollama | Full support — uses our tool system |
| Gemini | Partial — auto-reads files (bypasses read prompts) |
| Codex | Safe mode — backup/rollback for file changes |
| Mistral | Experimental — inconsistent tool support |

### Codex Safe Mode

Codex runs in "safe mode" by default. Since Codex's exec mode writes files directly (bypassing our tool system), PuzldAI:

1. **Backs up** source files before Codex runs
2. **Runs Codex** with `workspace-write` sandbox
3. **Detects changes** by comparing files after execution
4. **Applies approval mode**:
   - Plan mode → rolls back all changes
   - Accept/YOLO → keeps changes
   - Default → shows notification, keeps changes

<Warning>Codex changes are applied immediately, then rolled back if rejected. This differs from Claude/Ollama where you approve *before* changes are written.</Warning>
