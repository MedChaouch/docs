PuzldAI can index your entire codebase for intelligent context injection and semantic search.

## Quick Start

```bash
# TUI
/index              # Open indexing panel
/index full         # Full index with embeddings
/index quick        # Quick index without embeddings
/index search "auth" # Search indexed code
```

## TUI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/index` | Open interactive indexing panel |
| `/index full` | Full index with AST parsing and embeddings |
| `/index quick` | Quick index without embeddings |
| `/index search <query>` | Search indexed code semantically |
| `/index context <task>` | Get relevant code for a task |
| `/index config` | Show detected project configuration |
| `/index graph` | Show dependency graph |

## What Gets Indexed

| Data | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **AST Structure** | Functions, classes, interfaces, exports |
| **Dependencies** | Import/export relationships between files |
| **Project Config** | AGENTS.md, package.json, tsconfig.json |
| **Embeddings** | Semantic vectors for code search |

## Supported Languages

| Language | Extensions |
|----------|------------|
| TypeScript | `.ts`, `.tsx` |
| JavaScript | `.js`, `.jsx` |
| Python | `.py` |
| Go | `.go` |
| Rust | `.rs` |
| Java | `.java` |
| C/C++ | `.c`, `.cpp`, `.h` |

## Dependency Graph

The dependency graph tracks import/export relationships:

```
src/index.ts
├── imports: ./utils, ./config
└── exports: main, App

src/utils.ts
├── imports: lodash
└── exports: formatDate, parseJSON
```

Use this to understand how files connect and what might be affected by changes.

## Semantic Search

Search your codebase using natural language:

```bash
/index search "authentication logic"
/index search "database connection"
/index search "error handling"
```

Results are ranked by semantic similarity, not just keyword matching.

## Context Injection

When you ask questions or request changes, PuzldAI automatically:

1. Searches relevant code from the index
2. Injects matching files/functions as context
3. Gives agents better understanding of your codebase

## Storage

Index embeddings are stored in the vector store (part of the memory system):

```
~/.puzldai/
└── puzldai.db       # SQLite database with vector embeddings
```

Indexing runs on-demand. Use `/index full` for complete re-indexing with embeddings, or `/index quick` for faster AST-only parsing.
