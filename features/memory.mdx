---

PuzldAI includes a memory system that stores conversations, decisions, and code patterns for future retrieval.

<Tip>For codebase indexing and search, see [Indexing & Search](/features/indexing).</Tip>

## Memory Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `conversation` | Q&A pairs from sessions |
| `decision` | Accepted file edits and explanations |
| `code` | Code snippets and patterns |
| `pattern` | Reusable solutions |

## How It Works

1. **Automatic storage** — When you accept file edits, the decision is stored
2. **Semantic search** — Prompts are matched against stored memories
3. **Context injection** — Relevant memories are injected into agent prompts

## Storage

```
~/.puzldai/
├── memory.db        # SQLite FTS5 for memories
└── sessions/        # Chat history
```

## Embedding Models

When Ollama is available, PuzldAI uses embeddings for semantic search:

| Model | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `nomic-embed-text` | Recommended |
| `mxbai-embed-large` | Alternative |
| `all-minilm` | Lightweight |

If no embedding model is available, FTS5 full-text search is used.

## Sessions

Chat history is persisted between sessions:

```bash
# TUI
/session                  # Start new session
/resume                   # Resume previous session

# CLI
puzldai session list      # List sessions
puzldai session new       # Create new session
```
