## Welcome to PuzldAI

PuzldAI is a multi-LLM orchestration framework that wraps existing CLI tools (Claude, Gemini, Codex, Ollama, Mistral) — no API keys required. Route tasks to the best agent, compare responses, chain agents in pipelines, or let them collaborate. Agentic mode gives LLMs tools to explore your codebase and propose edits — like Claude Code, but for any LLM.
