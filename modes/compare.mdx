title: "Compare Mode"
description: "Run prompts on multiple models and compare responses"
---

Compare mode sends the same prompt to multiple AI models simultaneously and displays their responses side-by-side for easy comparison.

## Usage

### TUI (Interactive)

```bash
/compare <agents> "<prompt>"
/sequential      # toggle sequential execution
/pick            # toggle LLM picks best
```

### CLI

```bash
puzldai compare "<prompt>" -a <agents> [-s] [-p]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-a` | Comma-separated agents to compare |
| `-s` | Run sequentially instead of parallel |
| `-p` | Have an LLM pick the best response |

### Examples

```bash
# TUI: Compare Claude and Gemini
/compare claude,gemini "Explain microservices architecture"

# CLI: Compare three models with pick mode
puzldai compare "Write a binary search function" -a claude,gemini,ollama -p
```

## Features

### Side-by-Side View

Responses are displayed in columns, allowing you to easily compare:
- Response quality and completeness
- Different approaches to the same problem
- Response time for each model

### Sequential Mode

By default, all models run in parallel. Enable sequential mode to run one at a time:

```bash
/sequential    # Toggle sequential mode
```

This is useful when you want to see responses as they complete.

### Pick Mode

Enable pick mode to have an AI select the best response:

```bash
/pick          # Toggle pick mode
```

When enabled, after all responses are collected, an AI evaluates them and selects the best one with an explanation.

## Project Context

Compare mode automatically injects project structure context, so models understand your codebase without needing file access.
