title: "Consensus Mode"
description: "Collaborative decision-making with proposal and voting"
---

Consensus mode enables multiple AI models to collaborate on a task through a structured process of proposing solutions, voting, and synthesizing the best approach.

## Usage

```bash
/consensus <agents> "<prompt>"
```

### Examples

```bash
# Three-model consensus
/consensus claude,gemini,codex "Design the authentication system"

# Two-model consensus
/consensus claude,gemini "Choose the best database for our use case"
```

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Proposal Phase">
    Each agent independently proposes a solution to the task. They receive project structure context but don't see other agents' proposals to avoid bias.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Voting Rounds">
    Agents review all proposals and vote for the best one, providing reasoning. Multiple voting rounds allow positions to evolve.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Synthesis">
    A synthesizer agent analyzes the votes, identifies the winning proposal, and creates a unified final solution incorporating the best ideas.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

### Voting Rounds

By default, consensus runs 2 voting rounds. The number of rounds affects how much deliberation occurs before synthesis.

### Synthesizer

By default, the first agent in the list synthesizes the final result. You can specify a different synthesizer if needed.

## Actions After Consensus

After consensus completes, you can:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Accept** | Use the synthesized solution |
| **Build** | Enter Build mode to implement the solution |
| **Retry** | Run consensus again with the same task |
| **Edit** | Modify the task and run again |

## Project Context

Consensus mode automatically provides project structure to all agents, enabling them to make informed proposals that reference actual files and directories in your codebase.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Escape` | Hide view (keeps running in background) |
| `Ctrl+E` | Return to consensus view |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel operation |
| `↑/↓` | Navigate action options |
| `Enter` | Select action |

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Use consensus for architectural decisions** - When there are multiple valid approaches, consensus helps explore options and reach agreement.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Requires 2+ agents** - Consensus needs at least two models to vote and reach agreement.
</Warning>

## Example Output

```
─── Consensus ───

┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐
│ claude          │  │ gemini          │  │ codex           │
│ [proposal]      │  │ [proposal]      │  │ [proposal]      │
│ Use JWT with... │  │ Session-based...│  │ OAuth 2.0...    │
└─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘

Voting Round 1...
Winner: claude's proposal (2 votes)

Synthesis:
Based on the consensus, JWT authentication is recommended...
