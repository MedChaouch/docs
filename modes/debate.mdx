title: "Debate Mode"
description: "Multi-round discussions to explore ideas and trade-offs"
---

Debate mode facilitates structured discussions between AI models, allowing them to present arguments, respond to each other, and refine their positions over multiple rounds.

## Usage

### TUI (Interactive)

```bash
/debate <agents> "<topic>"
/settings        # configure rounds & moderator
```

### CLI

```bash
puzldai debate "<topic>" -a <agents> [-r rounds] [-m moderator]
```

### Examples

```bash
# TUI: Debate between Claude and Gemini
/debate claude,gemini "GraphQL vs REST for our API"

# CLI: Three-model debate with 3 rounds and moderator
puzldai debate "Monolith vs microservices" -a claude,gemini,codex -r 3 -m ollama
```

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Positions">
    Each agent presents their initial position on the topic. All agents respond in parallel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Response Rounds">
    In each subsequent round, agents read all previous responses and can:
    - Defend their position with new arguments
    - Address counterpoints from other agents
    - Update their view if convinced
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conclusion (Optional)">
    A moderator agent can synthesize the debate into a balanced conclusion, summarizing agreements and disagreements.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

### Rounds

The `--rounds` parameter controls how many rounds of debate occur:

```bash
/debate claude,gemini --rounds 3 "topic"
```

More rounds allow deeper exploration but take longer.

### Moderator

Add a moderator to synthesize the final conclusion:

```bash
/debate claude,gemini --rounds 2 --moderator codex "topic"
```

## When to Use Debate

Debate mode excels at:

- **Exploring trade-offs** - Different perspectives highlight pros and cons
- **Technical decisions** - Architecture, technology choices, design patterns
- **Edge case discovery** - Adversarial discussion uncovers potential issues
- **Learning** - See how different models reason about problems

## Example Output

```
─── Debate: GraphQL vs REST ───

Round 0 - Initial Positions:

claude: "GraphQL offers significant advantages for our use case..."

gemini: "REST remains the better choice because..."

Round 1 - Responses:

claude: "Addressing Gemini's point about caching..."

gemini: "While Claude makes valid points about flexibility..."

─── Moderator Conclusion ───
Both approaches have merit. For this specific project...
```

## Tips

<Tip>
**Choose complementary models** - Different models often have different strengths and perspectives.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**2-3 rounds is usually enough** - More rounds can lead to repetition without new insights.
