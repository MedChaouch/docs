</CardGroup>

## When to Use Each Mode

| Mode | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Compare** | Getting diverse perspectives, choosing between approaches |
| **Debate** | Exploring trade-offs, uncovering edge cases |
| **Correction** | Quality assurance, code review, fact-checking |
| **Consensus** | Complex decisions requiring agreement, architectural choices |

## Quick Examples

### Compare Mode
```bash
/compare claude,gemini "Write a function to parse JSON safely"
```

### Debate Mode
```bash
/debate claude,gemini "Should we use GraphQL or REST for this API?"
```

### Correction Mode
```bash
/correct claude gemini "Implement binary search"
```

### Consensus Mode
```bash
/consensus claude,gemini,codex "Design the database schema for a todo app"
```

## Background Execution

All multi-agent modes support background execution:

- Press **Escape** to hide the view and return to chat (execution continues)
- Press **Ctrl+E** to return and check progress
- Press **Ctrl+C** to cancel the operation

A status indicator shows progress when running in the background.
