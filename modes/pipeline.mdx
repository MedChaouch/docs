description: "Chain models together for multi-step workflows"
---

Pipeline mode chains multiple AI models together, where each step builds on the output of the previous step. This enables sophisticated multi-step workflows.

## Usage

### TUI (Interactive)

```bash
/workflow <name> "<prompt>"      # run saved workflow
/workflows                       # manage saved pipelines
/interactive                     # toggle pause between steps
```

### CLI

```bash
puzldai run "<prompt>" -P "<agent:action,agent:action,...>" [-i]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-P` | Pipeline steps (e.g., "gemini:analyze,claude:code") |
| `-T` | Use a saved pipeline template |
| `-i` | Interactive mode - pause between steps |

### Examples

```bash
# TUI: Run saved workflow
/workflow code-review "Build a rate limiter"

# CLI: Analyze → Code → Review pipeline
puzldai run "Build a rate limiter" -P "gemini:analyze,claude:code,codex:review" -i
```

## Available Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `analyze` | Analyze the task and provide insights |
| `code` | Write code for the task |
| `review` | Review and suggest improvements |
| `fix` | Fix issues identified in previous step |
| `test` | Write tests for the code |
| `summarize` | Summarize the content concisely |
| `prompt` | Generic prompt (default) |

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    First agent receives the original prompt and performs its action.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2">
    Second agent receives the original prompt PLUS the output from step 1.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step N">
    Each subsequent step receives all previous context, building on prior work.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Saved Workflows

Create and manage workflows through the `/workflows` interactive interface:

```bash
# Open workflow manager (create, edit, delete workflows)
/workflows

# Run a saved workflow
/workflow code-review "Build user authentication"
```

The `/workflows` manager lets you:
- Create new workflows with custom pipeline steps
- Edit existing workflow pipelines
- Delete workflows you no longer need
- View workflow details and step configuration

## Interactive Mode

Enable interactive mode to pause between steps:

```bash
/interactive    # Toggle interactive mode
```

When enabled, you can review each step's output before proceeding.

## Example Workflow

```
Pipeline: gemini:analyze → claude:code → codex:review

Step 1: gemini [analyze]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Analysis: The rate limiter should use a token bucket algorithm...

Step 2: claude [code]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```typescript
class RateLimiter {
  private tokens: number;
  ...
}
```

Step 3: codex [review]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Review: The implementation looks good. Suggestions:
1. Add thread safety...
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Escape` | Hide view (keeps running) |
| `Ctrl+E` | Return to pipeline view |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel pipeline |
| `Space` | Continue to next step (interactive mode) |

## Tips

<Tip>
**Match models to tasks** - Use models that excel at each step (e.g., Claude for code, Gemini for analysis).
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Keep pipelines focused** - 3-4 steps is usually optimal. Too many steps can compound errors.
